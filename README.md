# Keras LendingClub Loan Repayment Prediction Project

A TensorFlow Keras project to predict loan repayment on LendersClub dataset.

I apply Sequential and Dense layers to generate a deep neural network model, while ocntrolling the dropout rate.
The project also includes feature engineering, dealing with missing data and exploratory data analysis with visualisations.

This project is my first one and I've become more familiar with deep learning and NN applications, and I plan to improve further.
